Then the first snow came And she ran out to brush the snow away So it wouldnt die Came runnin in all excited Slipped and almost hurt herself And I laughed till I cried She was always young at heart Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so And I surprised her with a puppy Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago And it would sure embarrass her When I came in from workin late Cause I would know That shed been sittin there and cryin Over some sad and silly late late show And honey I miss you And Im bein good And Id love to be with you If only I could She wrecked the car and she was sad And so afraid that Id be mad But what the heck Though I pretended hard to be Guess you could say she saw through me And hugged my neck I came home unexpectedly And caught her cryin needlessly In the middle of the day And it was in the early Spring When flowers bloom and robins sing She went away  And honey I miss you And Im bein good And Id love to be with you If only I could One day while I was not at home While she was there and all alone The angels came Now all I have is memories of Honey And I wake up nights and call her name Now my lifes an empty stage Where Honey lived and Honey played And love grew up And a small cloud passes overhead And cries down on the flower bed That Honey loved And see the tree how big its grown But friend it hasnt been too long It wasnt big And I laughed at her and she got mad The first day that she planted it was just a twig 1 Sittin’ On The Dock of the Bay    Sittin in the mornin sun Ill be sittin when the evenin come Watching the ships roll in And

Classical Guitar Solo  Refrain Alone again naturally   Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears And at sixty five years old My mother God rest her soul Couldnt understand why the only man She had ever loved had been taken Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken And when she passed away I cried and cried all day  Refrain Alone again naturally Alone again naturally 23 A long long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe theyd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper Id deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldnt take one more step I cant remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died   So bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye Singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die   Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock n roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well I know that youre in love with him Cause I saw you dancin in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died   I started singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye And singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die See Don McLean Live  $107    Now for ten years weve been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin stone But thats not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died   We were singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye And singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die   Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh but we never got the chance Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died?   We started singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye And singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die   Oh and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick Cause fire is the devils only friend Oh and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satans spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died   He was singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye And singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die  Breakdown I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where Id heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldnt play And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died  Deleted Verse And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised Him everything I could give If only He would make the music live And He promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn   And they were singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye Singin Thisll be the day that I die Thisll be the day that I die   They were singin Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye Singin Thisll be the day that I die 125 Without You    No I cant forget this evening Or your face as you were leaving But I guess thats just the way the story goes You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes it shows   No I cant forget tomorrow When I think of all my sorrow When I had you there but then I let you go And now its only fair that I should let you know What you should know   I cant live if living is without you I cant live I cant give anymore I cant live if living is without you I cant give I cant give anymore   Well I cant forget this evening Or your face as you were leaving But I guess thats just the way the story goes You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows Yes it shows   Cant live if living is without you I cant live I cant give anymore I cant live if living is without you I cant live I cant give anymore   If living is without you  5 The Candy Man    Candy Man hey Candy Man Alright everybody gather around The Candy Man is here What kind of candy do you want?

Well the judge said guilty in a make believe trial Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile Said Suppers waitin at home and I gotta get to it Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia Thats the night that they hung an innocent man Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer Cause the judge in the towns got bloodstains on his hands Well they hung my brother before I could say The tracks he saw while on his way To Andys house and back that night were mine And his cheating wife had never left town And thats one body thatll never be found See little sister dont miss when she aims her gun Thats the night that the lights went out in Georgia whoa oh Thats the night that they hung an innocent man uh huh Well dont trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer Cause

seventeen That love was meant for beauty queens And high school girls with clear skinned smiles Who married young and then retired The valentines I never knew The Friday night charades of youth Were spent on one more beautiful At seventeen I learned the truth   And those of us with ravaged faces Lacking in the social graces Desperately remained at home Inventing lovers on the phone Who called to say Come dance with me And murmured vague obscenities It isnt all it seems At seventeen   A brown eyed girl in hand me downs Whose name I never could pronounce Said Pity please the ones who serve They only get what they deserve And the rich relationed hometown queen Marries into what she needs With a guarantee of company And haven for the elderly   Remember those who win the game Lose the love they sought to gain In debentures of quality And dubious integrity Their small town eyes will gape at you In dull surprise when payment due Exceeds accounts received At seventeen  Instrumental   To those of us who knew the pain Of valentines that never came And those whose names were never called When choosing sides for basketball It was long ago and far away The world was younger than today When dreams were all they gave for free To ugly duckling girls like me    We all play the game and  when we dare To cheat ourselves at solitaire Inventing lovers on the phone Repenting other lives unknown They call and say Come dance with me And murmur vague obscenities At ugly girls like me At seventeen 4 Pick Up the Pieces  Pick up the pieces uh huh Pick up the pieces alright Pick up the pieces uh

as an easy chair Love fresh as the morning air One love that is shared by two I have found with you Like a rose under the April snow I was always certain love would grow Love ageless and evergreen Seldom seen by two You and I will make each night a first Everyday a beginning Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed They warm and excite us Cause we have the brightest love Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun Time weve learned to sail above Time wont change the meaning of one love Ageless and ever evergreen  Angel In Your Arms  ANGEL IN YOUR ARMS Do you think Im such a fool to believe everything you say is true That just goes to show That you really dont know While youre out paintin the town Do you think Im home just sittin around waitin on you Now whos

your arms this morning Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight The angel in your arms this morning Is gonna be the devil in someone elses arms tonight  I Like Dreamin’  I like dreamin

Its all because of you Im feelin sad and blue You went away now my life is just a rainy day I love you so how much youll never know Youve gone away and left me lonely Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me Of love so true that once turned all my gray skies blue But you disappeared now my eyes are filled with tears Im wishin you were here with me Soft with love are my thoughts of you Now that youre gone oh I dont know what to do   If only you were here youd wash away my tears The sun would shine and once again youd be mine all mine But in reality you and I will never be Cause you took your love away from me oh If only you were here youd wash away my tears The sun would shine and once again youd be mine all mine But in reality you and I will never be Cause you took your love away from me Oh baby you took your love away from Me   Sayonara  1 The Winner Takes It All    I dont wanna talk About things weve gone through Though its hurting me now its history Ive played all my cards And thats what youve done too Nothing more to say no more ace to play   1 The winner takes it all The losers standing small Beside the victory Thats her destiny   I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense building me a fence Building me a home Thinking Id be strong there But I was a fool playing by the rules   2 The gods may throw the dice Their minds as cold as ice And

Is it a sure fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down? Oh you Why you wanna give me a run around? Is it a sure fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down? 7 I Can Love You Like That    They read you Cinderella You hoped it would come true And one day your Prince Charming Would come rescue you You like romantic movies And you never will forget The way you felt when Romeo Kissed Juliet And all this time that youve been waiting You dont have to wait no more   I can love you like that I would make you my world Move heaven and Earth If you were my girl I can give you my heart Be all that you need Show you youre everything Thats precious to me If you give me a chance I can love you like that I can love you like that   I never make a promise I dont intend to keep So when I say forever Forevers what I mean Well Im no Cassanova But I swear this much is true Ill be holding nothing back When it comes to you You dream of love thats everlasting Well baby open up your eyes   I can love you like that I would make you my world Move heaven and Earth If you were my girl I can give you my heart Be all that you need Show you youre everything Thats precious to me If you give me a chance I can love you like that I can love you like that    If you want tenderness I got tenderness And I see through To the heart of you If you want a man Who will understand You dont have to look very far I can love you Girl I can love you   I can love you like that I would make you my world Move heaven and Earth If you were my girl I can give you my heart Be all that you need Show you youre everything Thats precious to me If you give me a chance I can love you like that I can love you like that I can love you like that I would make you my world Move heaven and Earth If you were my girl I can give you my heart

1997,Goodbye Englands rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart You called out to our country And you whispered to those in pain Now you belong to heaven And the stars spell out your name  And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along Englands greenest hills Your candles burned out long before Your legend ever will  Loveliness weve lost These empty days without your smile This torch well always carry For our nations

Long live the king! One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain Once youd gone there was never Never an honest word And that was when I ruled the world  It was a wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldnt believe what Id become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?  I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain I know St Peter wont call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world  Oh oh oh oh oh oh  Hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I cant explain I know St Peter wont call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the worldThis was never the way I planned Not my intention I got so brave drink in hand Lost my discretion Its not what Im used to Just wanna try you on Im curious for you Caught my attention   I kissed a girl and I liked it The taste of her cherry chapstick I kissed a girl just to try it I hope my boyfriend dont mind it It felt so wrong it felt so right Dont mean Im in love tonight I kissed a girl and I liked it I liked it   No I dont even know your name It doesnt matter Youre my experimental game Just human nature Its not what good girls do Not how they should behave My head gets so confused Hard to obey   I kissed a girl and I liked it The taste of her cherry chapstick I kissed a girl just to try it I hope my boyfriend dont mind it It felt so wrong it felt so right Dont mean Im in love tonight I kissed a girl and I liked it I liked it  Bridge Us girls we are so magical Soft skin red lips so kissable Hard to resist so touchable Too good to deny it Aint no big deal its innocent See Katy Perry Live  $78    I kissed a girl and I liked it The taste of her cherry chapstick I kissed a girl just to try it I hope my boyfriend dont mind it It felt so wrong it felt so right Dont mean Im in love tonight I kissed a girl and I liked it I liked it 43 Whatever You Like    Aye Jim you know the ol sugar daddies?

never get to clean up the mess I made oh And that haunts me every time I close my eyes   It all just sounds like Ooh ooh Mm too young too dumb to realize   That I shouldve bought you flowers And held your hand Shoulda gave you all my hours When I had the chance Take you to every party Cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my babys dancin But shes dancin with another man  Bridge Although it hurts Ill be the first to say that I was wrong Oh I know Im probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know See Bruno Mars Live  $222    I hope he buys you

Once I was eleven years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once I was twenty years old my story got told Before the morning sun when life was lonely Once I was twenty years old  Lukas Graham!  I only see my goals I dont believe in failure Cause I know the smallest voices they can make it major I got my boys with me at least those in favor And if we dont meet before I leave I hope Ill see you later  Once I was twenty years old my story got told I was writing bout everything I saw before me Once I was twenty years old  Soon well be thirty years old our songs have been sold Weve traveled around the world and were still roaming Soon well be thirty years old  Im still learning about life My woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs And I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me Some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind My brother Im still sorry  Soon Ill be sixty years old my daddy got sixty one Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month  Soon Ill be sixty years old will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me? Soon Ill be sixty years old  Soon Ill be sixty years old will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
